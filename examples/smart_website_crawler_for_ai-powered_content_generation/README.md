**Smart Website Crawler for AI-Powered Content Generation**
=====================================================

**Overview**
-----------

The Smart Website Crawler is a powerful tool that extracts data from websites and generates AI-powered content. It uses Firecrawl, a web scraping and data extraction API, to crawl websites and extract relevant data. The extracted data is then used to generate AI-powered content using Pathway, a natural language processing (NLP) framework.

**Problem Statement**
-------------------

Extracting data from websites and generating high-quality content can be a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. This tool automates this process, allowing users to easily extract data from websites and generate AI-powered content.

**Technologies Used**
--------------------

* Firecrawl: A web scraping and data extraction API that extracts data from websites.
* Pathway: A natural language processing (NLP) framework that generates AI-powered content.

**Output**
---------

The output of this tool is a dataset of extracted data and generated AI-powered content. The dataset can be used for various applications such as AI-powered chatbots, article generation, and more.

**Features**
------------

* **Scraping**: Extracts data from websites using Firecrawl.
* **Crawling**: Crawls websites and extracts data from all accessible subpages.
* **LLM Extraction**: Extracts structured data from websites using LLM (Large Language Model) extraction.
* **Actions**: Performs various actions on web pages before scraping, such as clicking, scrolling, and inputting data.
* **Batch Scraping**: Allows users to scrape multiple URLs at once.

**How to Use**
--------------

### Installing the SDKs
-------------------------

### Running the Example
-------------------------

Here is an example of how to use the Smart Website Crawler:
```
import requests
import json
from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp
from pathway import Pathway

# Set your Firecrawl API key
firecrawl_api_key = "fc-YOUR_API_KEY"

# Set the URL to extract data from
url = "https://www.example.com"

# Create a FirecrawlApp instance
firecrawl_app = FirecrawlApp(api_key=firecrawl_api_key)

# Extract data from the website using Firecrawl
response = firecrawl_app.scrape_url(url, formats=["markdown", "html"])

# Extract the markdown content from the response
markdown_content = response["data"]["markdown"]

# Create a Pathway instance
pathway = Pathway()

# Use Pathway to generate AI-powered content from the markdown content
generated_content = pathway.generate_content(markdown_content)

# Print the generated content
print(generated_content)
```
This example demonstrates how to extract data from a website using Firecrawl and generate AI-powered content using Pathway.
