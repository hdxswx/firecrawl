**LLM-Powered ETL Framework for Real-Time Analytics**
=====================================================

Automate data extraction, processing, and analysis for real-time insights using Firecrawl and Pathway.

**Problem Statement**
-------------------

Extracting and processing large amounts of data from various sources for real-time analytics is a challenging task. Traditional ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes are often slow, cumbersome, and prone to errors. Firecrawl's LLM-powered ETL framework simplifies this process by leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to extract, transform, and load data in real-time.

**Technologies Used**
--------------------

* Firecrawl: An API service that extracts data from websites and converts it into clean markdown or structured data.
* Pathway: A real-time analytics platform that enables the creation of custom dashboards and visualizations.
* Python: A programming language used for scripting and automating tasks.
* LLM (Large Language Model): A type of AI model that is trained on large datasets and can generate human-like text.

**Output**
---------

A real-time analytics dashboard with insights on website traffic, user behavior, and other key metrics.

**How to Use It?**
-------------------

### Step 1: Set up Firecrawl API Key

Get an API key from [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev) and set it as an environment variable named `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` or pass it as a parameter to the `FirecrawlApp` class.

### Step 2: Define the Website to Crawl

Specify the website to crawl using the `scrape_url` method of the `FirecrawlApp` class.

### Step 3: Define the Data to Extract

Specify the data to extract using the `extract` parameter of the `scrape_url` method. You can extract specific data points such as titles, descriptions, and keywords.

### Step 4: Process the Extracted Data using LLM

Use the `generate` method of the LLaMA class to process the extracted data using the LLM. This step can be used to generate summaries, abstracts, or other text-based outputs.

### Step 5: Display the Processed Data in a Real-Time Analytics Dashboard

Use the processed data to create a real-time analytics dashboard using Pathway or other visualization tools.

**Example Code**
--------------

```python
import requests
import json
from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp
from langchain.llms import LLaMA

# Set up Firecrawl API key
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"

# Set up LLM
llama = LLaMA(
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=100,
    top_p=0.9,
    frequency_penalty=0.0,
    presence_penalty=0.6,
    stop_sequences=["\n"],
)

# Set up Firecrawl app
app = FirecrawlApp(api_key=FIRECRAWL_API_KEY)

# Define the website to crawl
website = "https://www.example.com"

# Define the data to extract
data_to_extract = ["title", "description", "keywords"]

# Crawl the website and extract the data
response = app.scrape_url(website, params={"formats": ["json"], "extract": data_to_extract})

# Process the extracted data using the LLM
processed_data = []
for item in response["data"]:
    output = llama.generate(text=item["content"], prompt=item["title"])
    processed_data.append({"title": item["title"], "description": output})

# Display the processed data in a real-time analytics dashboard
print(json.dumps(processed_data, indent=4))
```

**Features**
------------

* **Scraping**: Extract data from websites using Firecrawl's advanced scraping capabilities.
* **LLM Integration**: Use LLM to process and generate text-based outputs from extracted data.
* **Real-Time Analytics**: Create real-time analytics dashboards using Pathway or other visualization tools.
* **Customizable**: Customize the data extraction and processing pipeline to fit your specific use case.
